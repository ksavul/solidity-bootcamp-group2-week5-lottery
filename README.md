# Lottery DApp

This is a Lottery Decentralized Application (DApp) built using Solidity, Web3, and React. This DApp allows users to engage in a lottery system where they can place bets, check their earnings, withdraw their rewards, and much more.

## How it Works

Participants can join the lottery by placing bets using tokens. At a predetermined interval, a draw is made, and winners are selected at random from the pool of participants. Winners receive a proportionate amount of the pool, and the cycle restarts for the next round.

## Features

### Top Up Account with Tokens
- Users can load their accounts with a certain number of tokens to be used for bets.

### Bet with Account
- Allows users to bet using the tokens they have in their account.

### Check Player Prize
- Users can check if they have won any prizes in previous draws.

### Withdraw
- Winners can withdraw their prizes to their accounts.

### Burn Tokens
- Users have the option to destroy (burn) tokens.

### Open Bets
- The admin can open the bets for a new round.

### Close Bets
- The admin can close the bets, triggering the draw.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Metamask or other Web3 provider

### Installation

1. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

Once the development server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. Connect your Web3 provider to interact with the DApp.
